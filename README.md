### Manual Cleanup of Expired Registrations (Spark/Any Plan)

If you are on the Spark (free) plan or want to trigger cleanup manually, you can use the provided script:

1. Download your Firebase service account key from the Firebase Console (Project Settings > Service Accounts > Generate new private key).
2. Place the key file somewhere safe (e.g., `serviceAccountKey.json`).
3. Install the Firebase Admin SDK if you haven't already:

   ```powershell
   npm install firebase-admin
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```powershell
   node scripts/manualDeleteExpiredRegistrations.js path/to/serviceAccountKey.json
   ```

   This will delete all registrations whose `expiresAt` is in the past.

**Note:** The script assumes registrations are stored under `/carpools/{carpoolId}/registrations/{registrationId}`. Adjust the script if your structure is different.

> **Note:**
> Scheduled Cloud Functions (such as the registration cleanup) require the Firebase Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. If you are on the Spark (free) plan, scheduled cleanup will not run. Your data will not be automatically deleted until you upgrade to Blaze and deploy the function.

### Enabling Auto-Expiry After Upgrading to Blaze

1. Upgrade your Firebase project to the Blaze plan in the [Firebase Console > Billing](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/usage/details).
2. Make sure your `deleteExpiredRegistrations` function is present in your `functions/` directory and exported in `functions/index.js`.
3. Deploy your functions again:

   ```powershell
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

4. The scheduled cleanup will now run automatically every 15 minutes.

You can monitor function execution and logs in the Firebase Console under Functions > Logs.

# Easy Carpool

A carpooling app that facilitates finding carpool matches in the easiest way possible.

- **üìù GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/fernandoaestrella/easy-carpool](https://github.com/fernandoaestrella/easy-carpool)

## üåü Features

- **No account creation needed** - Jump right in and start organizing carpools
- **Automatic cleanup** - Ride registrations are automatically deleted 6 hours after their listed departure time (see [Registration Auto-Expiry](#registration-auto-expiry) below)
- **Smart sorting** - Rides sorted by departure times closest to your intended time
- **Easy contact sharing** - Copy all passenger contact info with a single click
- **Real-time updates** - See changes instantly across all connected devices

## üïí Registration Auto-Expiry

Every registration is automatically deleted 6 hours after its listed departure time:

- For fixed departures: 6 hours after the `fixedDepartureTime`.
- For flexible departures: 6 hours after the end of the time range (`departureTimeEnd`).

This is implemented by adding an `expiresAt` field (a UTC timestamp in ms) to each registration when it is created. A Firebase Cloud Function runs every 15 minutes and deletes any registration whose `expiresAt` is in the past.

### How to Deploy the Cleanup Cloud Function

1. **Install Firebase CLI and initialize functions** (if not already done):

   ```powershell
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   firebase login
   firebase init functions
   ```

2. **Copy the cleanup function**

   Place the file `functions/deleteExpiredRegistrations.js` (see this repo) into your `functions/` directory.

3. **Edit your `functions/index.js` or `functions/index.ts`**

   Add the following line to export the function:

   ```js
   exports.deleteExpiredRegistrations =
     require("./deleteExpiredRegistrations").deleteExpiredRegistrations;
   ```

4. **Deploy the function to Firebase**

   ```powershell
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

5. **Verify scheduled cleanup**

   - The function will run every 15 minutes and remove expired registrations from the database.
   - You can check logs in the [Firebase Console > Functions > Logs](https://console.firebase.google.com/) to confirm deletions.

**Note:**

- The function assumes registrations are stored under `/carpools/{carpoolId}/registrations/{registrationId}`. Adjust the path in `deleteExpiredRegistrations.js` if your structure is different.
- Requires Node.js 16+ and Firebase Functions SDK.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### File-Based Routing with Expo Router

The app uses **Expo Router** for file-based routing, providing automatic URL handling and universal deep linking:

```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _layout.tsx         # Root layout with Firebase initialization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx          # Landing page (/)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ +not-found.tsx     # 404 page for invalid URLs
```

### All Registrations Sorting & Time Difference

In the All Registrations tab, the app sorts all ride and waitlist registrations by how close their departure time is to your own registered departure time. This is done as follows:

- **Reference time**: Your own registration's departure time is used as the reference. If you selected a fixed departure time, that is used. If you selected a flexible time, the start of your time range is used.
- **Sorting**: All registrations are sorted by the absolute value of the time difference to your reference time. If two registrations are equally close, those with a later (positive) time difference are prioritized.
- **Display**: Above the Rides and Waitlist tabs, a line shows:  
  `Registrations sorted by those closest to your departure time of [your departure time]`
- **Time Difference**: Each registration card displays the time difference as:
  - `X hr Y mins after your departure time` (if the registration is later)
  - `X hr Y mins before your departure time` (if earlier)
  - `same as your departure time` (if exactly the same)

This helps you quickly see which rides or passengers are most relevant to your own travel plans.

### Navigation

- **`/`** - Landing page with app information and carpool creation
- **`/any-invalid-url`** - Shows Page Not Found with random playful messages
- Routes are automatically generated from files in the `app/` directory

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Routing**: Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting
- **Language**: TypeScript

## üé® Design Philosophy

### Responsive Width

Most main content is wrapped in a `ResponsiveContainer` component, which limits the maximum width to **65% of the screen on desktop and tablet** (width ‚â• 768px), and uses **100% width on mobile**. This ensures content remains readable and visually balanced on large screens, while being fully responsive on smaller devices.

### Style

The app follows an earthy, organic design with:

- Unsaturated, calming colors
- Rounded borders only on interactive elements
- Clean, open layouts that guide the eye naturally
- Subtle textures that evoke a grounded, natural feel

## üì± How It Works

1. **Create a carpool** - Set up a new carpool with trip details
2. **Share the link** - Share with potential riders and passengers
3. **Register your trip** - Choose to offer a ride or join as a passenger
4. **Connect with others** - View matches and coordinate your shared ride

### Page Not Found (404)

The app includes a delightful 404 page with:

- **Random playful messages** - Carpool-themed headings like "Looks like this ride took a wrong turn!"
- **Helpful suggestions** - Guidance to check the URL or ask for a new link
- **Beautiful illustration** - Mountain road scene with directional signs
- **Easy navigation** - "Back to Safe Roads" button returns to home

### Registration Editing & Data Persistence

When a user edits their registration, the app deletes the previous registration from both Firebase Realtime Database and the browser's localStorage before saving the new registration. This ensures only the latest registration is kept and shown. Registration data is always loaded from localStorage (and refreshed from Firebase if needed) to persist across browser sessions.

**Timezone Handling:**

- The carpool's timezone (e.g., "America/Toronto") is stored only in the carpool object, not in individual ride or passenger registrations.
- When displaying registration details (e.g., in modals or cards), the carpool timezone is passed as a prop from the parent (carpool) context down to all registration detail components.
- This ensures all time and date displays are shown in the correct timezone, even though the registration objects themselves do not contain a timezone field.
- If you add new components that display registration times, ensure they receive the carpool timezone as a prop.

### Form and FormField Components

The form system is built around two components: Form and FormField, both found in components.

#### Form:

Manages the state and validation for a group of fields.
Accepts a fields array (each field is a config object) and an onSubmit callback.
Handles value changes, required field validation, and field-type-specific validation (email, phone, number, dropdown).
Renders a FormField for each field config, passing value, error, and change handler.
Optionally, wraps children (e.g., a submit button) and injects the submit handler.

#### Dynamic Form Architecture

The form system supports dynamic field visibility using a `showIf` property on field configs. This allows fields to appear or disappear based on the current form values (e.g., checking a checkbox reveals more fields).

- **Form state is managed in the parent (`RegistrationModal`)**. The parent holds the current form values and filters the field list before passing it to the `Form`.
- **Field configs can include a `showIf` function**: If present, the field is only shown when `showIf(formValues)` returns true.
- **The `Form` component is controlled**: It receives `values` and `onChange` props, and updates the parent on every change.
- **This enables dynamic, conditional forms**: For example, checking "Flexible Departure Time" will show the time range fields, while unchecking it will show a single time field.

##### Example field config with `showIf`:

```js
{
  key: "departureTimeStart",
  label: "Departure Time Start",
  type: "time",
  required: true,
  showIf: (values) => values.isFlexibleTime,
}
```

##### Example usage in parent:

```js
const [formValues, setFormValues] = useState({});
const filteredFields = fields.filter(
  (field) => !field.showIf || field.showIf(formValues)
);
<Form
  fields={filteredFields}
  values={formValues}
  onChange={setFormValues}
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
/>;
```

This pattern allows for highly flexible, dynamic forms with minimal boilerplate.

#### How they are used:

Define an array of field configs and pass it to Form.
Place any submit button as a child of Form (it will receive the submit handler).
Form manages all state, validation, and submission logic; FormField only handles display and input for a single field.

#### Example field config:

```ts
const fields = [
  { key: "name", label: "Name", type: "text", required: true },
  { key: "email", label: "Email", type: "email", required: true },
  { key: "phone", label: "Phone", type: "phone" },
  {
    key: "departureDate",
    label: "Departure Date",
    type: "date",
    required: true,
  },
  {
    key: "departureTime",
    label: "Departure Time",
    type: "time",
    required: true,
  },
  { key: "flexible", label: "Flexible Departure", type: "checkbox" },
  {
    key: "luggage",
    label: "Luggage Size",
    type: "dropdown",
    options: [
      { label: "Small", value: "small" },
      { label: "Medium", value: "medium" },
      { label: "Large", value: "large" },
    ],
  },
  { key: "notes", label: "Notes", type: "multiline_text" },
  {
    key: "summary",
    label: "Summary",
    type: "display",
    value: "This is a read-only summary.",
  },
  { key: "timezone", label: "Timezone", type: "timezone" },
];
```

Place any submit button as a child of Form (it will receive the submit handler).
Form manages all state, validation, and submission logic; FormField only handles display and input for a single field.

#### What can be done:

Build forms with required fields, email validation, and custom field types.
Centralize validation and state management for all fields in one place.
Easily add new field types by extending FormField.

#### What cannot be done:

Use FormField outside of a Form (it will not manage its own state or validation).
Use uncontrolled inputs (all fields are controlled by the Form state).

#### Cross-field validation: Contact Method

The form enforces that at least one contact method (email or phone) is provided. If the user submits the form with both fields empty, an error message is shown under both fields: "Please provide at least one contact method". This error is cleared as soon as the user starts editing either field. The error message is only shown after a submit attempt with both fields empty, and not while filling out the form.

The `Form` component also supports an `externalErrors` prop, which allows you to display custom error messages for any field, such as for cross-field validation.
